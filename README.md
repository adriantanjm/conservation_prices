# An Exploratory Study of Successful Tender Prices of Conservation Sites in Singapore

This study employs data drawn from successful tender prices of conservation sites in Singapore in the period of 1987 to 2007. The purpose of this study is to explore the trends of the conservation site market using time-series analysis. It also aims to explore the variables affecting the successful tender prices of these conservation site using random forest regression analysis. This study uses the year 1987 as the starting year of analysis because it was the year when these conservation sites were gazetted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority for conservation.

## Key Findings

The main findings of the research are:

1. The conservation site with the highest median tender price per SQM is River Valley, conversely, the site with the lowest median tender price per SQM is Outram.

2. The majority of conservation sites are slated for mixed use, followed by commercial use. Only a small handful of conservation sites are slated for residential use.

3. The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 significantly influenced the conservation site market as evidenced by the declining trend of tender prices from 1998.

4. Almost all conservation sites in the study, except for Chinatown, shared the same trend for tender prices. They first experience a decline before peaking up again.

5. Chinatown experiences an increasing trend of popularity among bidders, leading an observed incremental trend in tender prices.

6. The random forest regression analysis suggests that the more influential variables in influencing the tender prices of conservation site are (1) size of conservation sites and (2) slated purpose of the conservation site.
